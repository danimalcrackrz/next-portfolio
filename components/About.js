      <p>
        Since I was 16, I&apos;ve had a passion for building digital
        products/anything I want. I love to solve complex problems, and to
        create meaningful <span className='about-decorator'>&&</span> memorable
        solutions. When not in front of my computer you can usually find me in a
        huge pile of Legos, with a cup of coffee or tea nearby. Well-Organized,
        problem-solver, <span className='about-decorator'>&&</span> driven with
        high attention to detail. Big fan of Bob&apos;s Burgers, String Theory,
        and Black Holes.
